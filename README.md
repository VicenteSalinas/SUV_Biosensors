# SUV Biosensors
In this repository, you will find the supplementary material for the article submitted to the MDPI journal Biosensors. In this article, we measured the changes in the behavior of resonant ultrasonic transducers when interacting with different biofluids.

The files named FL_XXX.csv contain 300 data sets showing the temporal evolution of the transducer parameters with the high temporal resolution experimental system.

The file Data_PEG_REP.zip includes the repeated measurement data of the transducer parameters for various concentrations of Polyethylene Glycol 8000.

The file Data_GIL_REP.zip contains the repeated measurement data of the transducer parameters for different concentrations of Glycerol.

The file Data_KIN_f1.zip holds the temporal evolution data of the transducer parameters for the interaction of BSA with Urea using the low temporal resolution experimental system.
